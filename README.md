# 💡 Skill Swap – A Community-Based Knowledge Exchange Platform

Skill Swap is a modern web platform that allows individuals to exchange skills and knowledge with others in the community. Instead of traditional courses, users can learn directly from others by offering what they know in return. Whether it's graphic design, coding, cooking, or language learning – Skill Swap is the space where learners become teachers and teachers keep learning.
